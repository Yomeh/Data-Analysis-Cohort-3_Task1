# Task One
This is the first assigned task from the 3rd Data Analysis Cohort with Promise Chinonso

# Introduction
As part of the learning process of the 3rd data analysis training by Promise Chinonso, we were assigned the task of creating a table of information for our first task, which consists of 20 rows and 5 columns and included the following information: Employee ID, Employee Full Name, Department, Salary and Job Type.

# Activity
We are to show the employees who are working as freelancers and earning above $10,000.
Split the employees' full names into first names and last names, highlighting any form of duplicate value in the table.
Highlight employees whose names start with E in yellow colour, and highlight the highest salary value in green and the lowest salary value in red.

# Skills Demonstrated
1. Data Manipulation
2. Use of filters
3. Text-Column
4. Conditional Formatting

# Data Manipulation
As the first activity for this task, I used the filter function to the headers for each column in the table and then filtered the data from the Job type column to show employees working as freelancers. After getting this result, I applied the conditional formatting function to the salary column to highlight cells where the salary was greater than $10,000 in blue.

The second activity was to split the employees' full names into first and last name columns. To do this, I inserted an extra column to the right of the employee full name column then used the text-to-column function located in the data tab, specifying space as the delimiter between my data. Then in order to find duplicates, I applied the conditional formatting function on my data set, and the duplicate names with the same information were highlighted in green.

For the last activity, to get the names of employees' that began with E, I applied the filter function to the names column to identify names beginning with E, I then highlighted the results manually using the text function. After this, I applied the conditional formatting to the salary column so as to highlight the cells with the highest value in green colour and the lowest in red colour.

# Conclusion
This was quite a fun task to do, as we were just been introduced to data analytics using the Excel tool. I look forward to exploring more with Promise Chinoso in the world of Data analysis.
